# Weburz's Base Project Template

This repository is a template to create a simple and basic project at Weburz. It
contains the base skeleton resources required for any and all projects built
within Weburz. Hence, this repository should ideally be used to generate
repositories for other future projects in Weburz.

More information about this repository will be added as and when necessary!

## Usage Guidelines

This template repository is supposed to be used with
[`cookiecutter`](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io) to generate an extremely
simple and generic repository to work on at Weburz. Hence, to get started with
using the repository;

1. Ensure you have `cookiecutter` installed (if not follow the guidelines as
   stated in the documentation linked above).
2. Run the following command to generate a template repository with all the
   necessary skeleton files.

   ```console
   cookiecutter gh:Weburz/cookiecutter-project-base
   ```

With the project generated, change the directory in to the project's directory
and start working on it as you deem it fit to.
