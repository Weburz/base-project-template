# Weburz's Base Project Template

[![QA Checks](https://github.com/Weburz/cookiecutter-templates/actions/workflows/qa-check.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Weburz/cookiecutter-templates/actions/workflows/qa-check.yml)

This repository contains a bunch of templates to quickly generate projects at
Weburz. It contains the base skeleton resources required for any and all
projects built within Weburz. Hence, this repository should ideally be used to
generate repositories for other future projects in Weburz.

More information about this repository will be added as and when necessary!

## Usage Guidelines

This template repository is supposed to be used with
[`cookiecutter`](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io) to generate a template
repository to start work on at Weburz. Hence, to get started with using the
repository;

1. Ensure you have `cookiecutter` installed (if not follow the guidelines as
   stated in the documentation linked above).
2. Run the following command to generate a template repository with all the
   necessary skeleton files.

   ```console
   cookiecutter gh:Weburz/cookiecutter-templates
   ```

3. With that you will be prompted to select the right template, so choose the
   appropriate template before starting work with it.

With the project generated, change the directory in to the project's directory
and start working on it as you deem it fit to.
